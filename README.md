Pig Game: This is a simple game where two players take turns rolling a dice. 
Each player's score is the sum of all the dice rolls they have made during their turn.
If a player rolls a 1, their score for that turn is reset to 0 and it becomes the other player's turn.
The first player to reach a score of 100 or more wins the game.
